'''
eprints2bags: download records from an EPrints server and bag them up

Materials in EPrints must be extracted before they can be moved to a
preservation system such as DPN or another long-term storage or dark archive.
The program eprints2bags encapsulates the processes needed to gather the
materials and bundle them up in BagIt bags.

Historical note
---------------

The original idea and some starting algorithms for this code came from the
eprints2dpn (https://github.com/caltechlibrary/eprints2dpn) collection of
Perl scripts written by Betsy Coles in early 2018.

    '''eprints2bags bags up EPrints content as BagIt bags.

This program contacts an EPrints REST server whose network API is accessible
at the URL given by the command-line option -a (or /a on Windows).  A typical
EPrints server URL has the form "https://server.institution.edu/rest".  This
program will automatically add "/eprint" to the URL path, so omit that part
of the URL in the value given to -a.

Specifying which records to get
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The EPrints records to be written will be limited to the list of EPrints
numbers found in the file given by the option -i (or /i on Windows).  If no
-i option is given, this program will download all the contents available at
the given EPrints server.  The value of -i can also be one or more integers
separated by commas (e.g., -i 54602,54604), or a range of numbers separated
by a dash (e.g., -i 1-100, which is interpreted as the list of numbers 1, 2,
..., 100 inclusive), or some combination thereof.  In those cases, the
records written will be limited to those numbered.

If the -l option (or /l on Windows) is given, the records will be additionally
filtered to return only those whose last-modified date/time stamp is no older
than the given date/time description.  Valid descriptors are those accepted
by the Python dateparser library.  Make sure to enclose descriptions within
single or double quotes.  Examples:

  eprints2bags -l "2 weeks ago" -a ....
  eprints2bags -l "2014-08-29"  -a ....
  eprints2bags -l "12 Dec 2014" -a ....
  eprints2bags -l "July 4, 2013" -a ....

If the -s option (or /s on Windows) is given, the records will also be filtered
to include only those whose eprint_status element value is one of the listed
status codes.  Comparisons are done in a case-insensitive manner.  Putting a
caret character ("^") in front of the status (or status list) negates the
sense, so that eprints2bags will only keep those records whose eprint_status
value is *not* among those given.  Examples:

  eprints2bags -s archive -a ...
  eprints2bags -s ^inbox,buffer,deletion -a ...

If the option -d (or /d on Windows) is given, the records will be further
filtered by comparing them to copies found at the location indicated by the
directory given as the value to the -d option.  Only those records that are
different in content will be kept.  The directory should contain archived
EPrints records in the same form written by a prior run of eprints2bags.  As
eprints2bags retrieves records from the EPrints server, it will check the -d
directory for the existence of a bag with the same EPrints record number and
named using the same the same value of the -n option (if the option is given);
i.e., for a record N from the EPrints server, it will check for the existence
of /path/to/directory/N, /path/to/directory/N.zip, /path/to/directory/N.tar,
and /path/to/directory/N.tar.gz, or if the -n option is given with a value of
NAME, for /path/to/directory/NAME-N, /path/to/directory/NAME-N.zip, and so on.
If no such bag is found, eprints2bags proceeds normally to bag the entire
contents of the EPrints record; on the other hand, if a previous bag is found
in the -d directory, eprints2bags will compare its contents to the contents
retrieved from the EPrints server, and only write the contents that are
different.  To make it clear that the written bag may not be not complete,
it will have "-diff" as part of the name.  Option -d is useful when running
eprints2bags regularly: if you keep the output of a prior run on disk, you
can re-run eprints2bags with the -d option to make it save only the records
that have actually changed in content, which may reduce the number of records
that need to be archived (assume you already archived the prior run).

The lastmod, status, and diff-based filering are done after the -i argument
is processed.

By default, if an error occurs when requesting a record from the EPrints
server, it stops execution of eprints2bags.  Common causes of errors include
missing records implied by the arguments to -i, missing files associated with
a given record, and files inaccessible due to permissions errors.  If the
option -k (or /k on Windows) is given, eprints2bags will attempt to keep going
upon encountering missing records, or missing files within records, or similar
errors.  Option -k is particularly useful when giving a range of numbers with
the -i option, as it is common for EPrints records to be updated or deleted and
gaps to be left in the numbering.  (Running without -i will skip over gaps in
the numbering because the available record numbers will be obtained directly
from the server, which is unlike the user providing a list of record numbers
that may or may not exist on the server.  However, even without -i, errors may
still result from permissions errors or other causes.)

Specifying what to do with the output
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This program writes its output in subdirectories under the directory given by
the command-line option -o (or /o on Windows).  If the directory does not
exist, this program will create it.  If no -o is given, the current directory
where eprints2bags is running is used.  Whatever the destination is,
eprints2bags will create subdirectories in the destination, with each
subdirectory named according to the EPrints record number (e.g.,
/path/to/output/43, /path/to/output/44, /path/to/output/45, ...).  If the
-n option (/n on Windows) is given, the subdirectory names are changed to
have the form NAME-NUMBER_ where NAME is the text string provided to the -n
option and the NUMBER is the EPrints number for a given entry (meaning,
/path/to/output/NAME-43, /path/to/output/NAME-44, /path/to/output/NAME-45, ...).

Each directory will contain an EP3XML XML file and additional document
file(s) associated with the EPrints record in question.  Documents associated
with each record will be fetched over the network.  The list of documents for
each record is determined from XML file, in the <documents> element.  Certain
EPrints internal documents such as "indexcodes.txt" and preview images
will be ignored.

Each record downloaded from EPrints will be placed in a BagIt style directory
and each bag will also be put into a single-file archive by default.  The
default archive file format is ZIP with compression turned off (see next
paragraph).  Option -b (/b on Windows) can be used to change this behavior.
This option takes a keyword value; possible values are "none", "bag" and
"bag-and-archive", with the last being the default.  Value "none" will cause
eprints2bags to leave the downloaded record content in individual directories
without bagging or archiving, and value "bag" will cause eprints2bags to
create BagIt bags but not single-file archives from the results.  The content
directories will be left in the output directory (the location given by the
-o or /o option).  Note that creating bags is a destructive operation: it
replaces the individual directories of each record with a restructured
directory corresponding to the BagIt format.

The type of archive made when "bag-and-archive" mode is used for the -b
option can be changed using the option -t (or /t on Windows).  The possible
values are: "compressed-zip", "uncompressed-zip", "compressed-tar", and
"uncompressed-tar".  As mentioned above, the default is "uncompressed-zip"
(used if no -t option is given).  ZIP is the default because it is more
widely recognized and supported than tar format, and uncompressed ZIP is used
because file corruption is generally more damaging to a compressed archive
than an uncompressed one.  Since the main use case for eprints2bags is to
archive contents for long-term storage, avoiding compression seems safer.

Finally, the overall collection of EPrints records (whether the records are
bagged and archived, or just bagged, or left as-is) can optionally be itself
put into a bag and/or put in a ZIP archive.  This behavior can be changed with
the option -e (/e on Windows).  Like -b, this option takes the possible values
"none", "bag", and "bag-and-archive".  The default is "none".  If the value
"bag" is used, a top-level bag containing the individual EPrints bags is
created out of the output directory (the location given by the -o option);
if the value "bag-and-archive" is used, the bag is also put into a single-file
archive.  (In other words, the result will be a ZIP archive of a bag whose
data directory contains other ZIP archives of bags.)  For safety, eprints2bags
will refuse to do "bag" or "bag-and-archive" unless a separate output directory
is given via the -o option; otherwise, this would restructure the current
directory where eprints2bags is running -- with potentially unexpected or even
catastrophic results.  (Imagine if the current directory were the user's home
directory!)

The use of separate options for the different stages provides some flexibility
in choosing the final output.  For example,

  eprints2bags  --bag-action  none  --end-action  bag-and-archive

will create a ZIP archive containing a single bag directory whose `data/`
subdirectory contains the set of (unbagged) EPrints records retrieved by
`eprints2bags` from the server.

Server credentials
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Downloading documents usually requires supplying a user login and password to
the EPrints server.  By default, this program uses the operating system's
keyring/keychain functionality to get a user name and password.  If the
information does not exist from a previous run of eprints2bags, it will query
the user interactively for the user name and password, and (unless the -K or
/K argument is given) store them in the user's keyring/keychain so that it
does not have to ask again in the future.  It is also possible to supply the
information directly on the command line using the -u and -p options (or /u
and /p on Windows), but this is discouraged because it is insecure on
multiuser computer systems.  If a given EPrints server does not require a user
name and password, do not use -u or -p and leave the values blank when
prompted for them by eprints2bags.  (Empty user name and password are allowed
values.)

To reset the user name and password (e.g., if a mistake was made the last
time and the wrong credentials were stored in the keyring/keychain system),
add the -R (or /R on Windows) command-line argument to a command.  When
eprints2bags is run with this option, it will query for the user name and
password again even if an entry already exists in the keyring or keychain.

Other command-line arguments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Generating checksum values can be a time-consuming operation for large bags.
By default, during the bagging step, eprints2bags will use a number of
processes equal to one-half of the available CPUs on the computer.  The number
of processes can be changed using the option -c (or /c on Windows).

eprints2bags will print messages as it works.  To reduce the number of
messages to warnings and errors, use the option -q (or /q on Windows).  Also,
output is color-coded by default unless the -C option (or /C on Windows) is
given; this option can be helpful if the color control signals create
problems for your terminal emulator.

If given the -@ argument (/@ on Windows), this program will output a detailed
trace of what it is doing, and will also drop into a debugger upon the
occurrence of any errors.  The debug trace will be written to the given
destination, which can be a dash character (-) to indicate console output, or
a file path.

If given the -V option (/V on Windows), this program will print the version
and other information, and exit without doing anything else.

Additional notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Beware that some file systems have limitations on the number of
subdirectories that can be created, which directly impacts how many record
subdirectories can be created by this program.  eprints2bags attempts to
guess the type of file system where the output is being written and warn the
user if the number of records exceeds known maximums (e.g., 31,998
subdirectories for the ext2 and ext3 file systems in Linux), but its internal
table does not include all possible file systems and it may not be able to
warn users in all cases.  If you encounter file system limitations on the
number of subdirectories that can be created, a simple solution is to
manually create an intermediate level of subdirectories under the destination
given to -o, then run eprints2bags multiple times, each time indicating a
different subrange of records to the -i option and a different subdirectory
to -o, such that the number of records written to each destination is below
the file system's limit on total number of directories.

It is also noteworthy that hitting a server for tens of thousands of records
and documents in rapid succession is likely to draw suspicion from server
administrators.  By default, this program inserts a small delay between
record fetches (adjustable using the -y command-line option), which may be
too short in some cases.  Setting the value to 0 is also possible, but might
get you blocked or banned from an institution's servers.
